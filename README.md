Around three years ago, I created my personal website using React.js. However, as the web-development landscape evolved, Next.js emerged as a prominent framework for React.js, prompting me to redesign my personal website using Next.js. Originally, my intention was to develop a comprehensive backend and integrate database functionalities. However, considering that personal websites often require infrequent updates and mainly consist of static resources like photos, I made the decision to primarily focus on enhancing the frontend.

The current iteration of my website serves as a platform to curate and showcase my experiences and photos. Looking ahead, I am contemplating the possibility of incorporating a fully operational backend. This potential transformation could turn my website into a dynamic medium for mutual communication, featuring elements like comments and chats, offering a more engaging and interactive user experience.
